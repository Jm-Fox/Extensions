Usage:
1. Run the project
2. Provide the name of a json file (ex. DayIs42.json)
3. Provide a DateTime to evaluate

This project has two main concerns:

1. Verify that dynamic type resolution works and step through the code
2. Proof of concept for configuring expressions (inspired by https://elmah.github.io/a/error-filtering/)

ABSOLUTELY NO GUARANTEES are made about the correctness of the expression evaluation in this project.
